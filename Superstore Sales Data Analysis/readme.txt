## Superstore Sales Data Analysis 

This folder contains three two files:
train.csv.zip - original data set (zip file) 
SuperstoreSalesDataAnalysis.ipynb - python code file (jupyter notebook) 

Overview:
The project focuses on analyzing sales data for a superstore, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle and downloaded via the Kaggle API. To ensure accurate and consistent analysis, the dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process. This involved handling null and duplicate values, standardizing columns, and ensuring error-free data. After the cleaning process, various analyses were performed according to the specified requirements, different graphs and visualizations were generated to provide insights into the sales performance, helping to identify trends and key metrics crucial for decision-making. This project demonstrates my competence with the python and its different data analysis libraries as well as showcasing my abilities in data cleaning and analysis by being able to convert raw data into actional insights.

Modules used: 
pandas module for data cleaning and assisting with visaulization 
matplotlib moddule for data visualization
seaborn module for data visualization
kaggle module for connecting downloading data set from kaggle
zipfile module to work for zipfiles 

The dataset has been analyzed as per the following requirements: 
- analyze the most popular shipping method.
- analyze the sales per segmentation.
- analyze the sales per region.
- analyze the sales per product category.
- analyze the sales per product category.
